- Created Rails backend API that gives out JSON containing an array of Karmas, each made of an entry for Karma and date.

- Created a front end app that has one main page for KARMA BANK and 2 buttons WITHDRAW and DEPOSIT.

- The button for WITHDRAW opens up vue modal containing a random quote from the axios request.

- The button for DEPOSIT opens up a vue modal containing an input form for taking in the users positive experience to be saved in the bank for future withdrawal.

- Handled CORS. Added my domain in the Origin and Resource of the config/initializers/cors.rb and added gem 'rack-cors'.

- Created a minified production build in the front end. Copied the dist folder to back-end public folder. Deployed it to Heroku.

- Designed the front end main app page.
